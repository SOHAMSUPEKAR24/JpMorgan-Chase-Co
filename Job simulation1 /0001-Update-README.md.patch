+# Task Overview #
+# What you'll learn
+How Software Engineers help JPMorgan Chase traders by building dashboards to better identify under/over-valued stocks.
+How to set up your dev environment by installing python, forking and cloning the starter repo and installing project dependencies
+What an engineering ticket looks like
+# What you'll do
+Set up your local dev environment by downloading the necessary files, tools and dependencies
+Fix the broken client datafeed script in the repository
+Optional: add unit tests in the test script in the repository
+
+# Here is the background information on your task #
+You’ve been asked to assist with some development to add a chart to a trader’s dashboard allowing them to better identify under/over-valued stocks.
+
+The trader would like to be able to monitor two historically correlated stocks and be able to visualize when the correlation between the two weakens (i.e. one stock moves proportionally more than the historical correlation would imply). This could indicate a potential trade strategy to simultaneously buy the relatively underperforming stock and sell the relatively outperforming stock. Assuming the two prices subsequently converge, the trade should be profitable.
+
+Most data visualization for our traders is built on JPMorgan Chase's Perspective data visualization software, which is now open source. If you want to explore that, a link is provided in the resources section.
+
+Before implementing this request using perspective, first, you’ll need to interface with the relevant financial data feed and make the necessary adjustments to facilitate the monitoring of potential trade opportunities.
